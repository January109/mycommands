# mycommands
This repository contains `commands.sty`, a file which I use to write LaTeX documents. It is provided here in the hope that it may be useful for others.

Please note that things might be changed or removed so this document should not be relied on for backwards compatibility.

Look at the `example.tex` file for example usage of some of the things in `commands.sty`.
